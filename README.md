Extention

## Overview

This is my first Chrome extension project, created as a learning experience to explore Chrome extension development. By creating this extension, I gained valuable insights into how Chrome extensions are built and how they interact with web pages and browser functionality.

Through this project, I aimed to acquire practical knowledge on Chrome extension development and understand the process involved in creating extensions from scratch. By following tutorials, reading documentation, and experimenting with different features, I was able to gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of web technologies.

By using this extension, you will gain knowledge on how to create Chrome extensions and get some practical experience in building browser add-ons. I created this extension because I wanted to know how extensions get created and to challenge myself to learn new skills in web development.
